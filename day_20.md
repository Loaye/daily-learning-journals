Daily Journal - Class 20

It was final presentations and end of the class. We did not do any coding, also with being gone I did not get to see any of the other projects. During the week, I was able to some of the other students and their projects and was able to see how they made features for their projects. I was able to learn new and simplified ways to write code. Also naming conventions that I would never of thought of in the past. Just adding more tools to my arsenal.
