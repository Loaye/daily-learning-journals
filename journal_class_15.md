Daily Journal - Class 15

End of the week, end of busmall, and start of project week. It was a good week, was a little hard catching up with missing one day for surgery. I learned the most with JS this week by forcing myself to dive in and ask for help. Local storage seemed a lot more daunting then what it actually was, it was a lot more plug and play. Creating, a save, load, render state was easy but it was a little weird finding the right place to put them in.
