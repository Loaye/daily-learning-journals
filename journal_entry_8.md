Daily Journal - Class 10

This week was the biggest on self reflecting. I liked the fact that I could take what I learned from the stack module learning and apply it on my terms. Rather that keeping up with everyone and not getting, taking a step back and taking a little bit longer is setting me up for success. I feel like I am building good momentum. The T.A's have helped me understand more with plugging information into table/strings and pulling them out and isolating them to be able to manipulate them in any manor that I would like to. This has been a good week!
