Daily Journal - Class 8

Today I learned how to apply js edits of html that we learned 2 days ago. I also came to a thought that I should not try and do everything that everyone else is doing. I need to go more at my pace and it may be a bit slower, but I am understanding it a lot better. Which is awesome!!
