# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

I did not really learn anything today. Just solidified what I am knowing. I was able to mess around with the parameters of what can be done in if/else statements. I am forcing myself to work on EQ by being a little bit more social. It is only day 2 so it is hard to really say anything besides how much I love learning this stuff so far.
